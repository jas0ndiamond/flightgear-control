# flightgear-control

Control and interact with a FlightGear aircraft generically using telnet and sockets. 

Easily and economically simulate a complex real-world machine with mechanical causality.

Generically fly aircraft by executing the plane's engine startup script and diligently correcting drift and deviation from a flight path by constantly repositioning the plane orientation within the simulator environment along a set of waypoints.
